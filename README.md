## Belly Buttion Biodiversity
### Overview
Used JavaScript, Plotly.js, D3.js,  HTML, Web Browser to complete a dashboard to show visulations for bacterial data for each volunteer with samples of bacteria. Volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This will help Improbable Beef identify a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef. Each volunteer will be able to identify whether their species is found in their navel. 
### Results
1. Horizontal Bar Chart
  Displays the top 10 bacterial species (OTU's) when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. THe bar chart       will display values and labels. The labels will produce information regarding the OTU if user hovers over bars on chart. 

2.  Bubble Chart
  Once an Individual Id is selected from dropdown menu the Bacteria Cultures Per Sample will be displayed. The Sample IDS or OTU IDs are the x-axis and the values of the samples     are the yaxis. The sample values will determine the size of the marker size in this case a bubble. Each OTU Id also has a unique colors. The otu labels will produce hover-text     values.
  
3. Gauge Chart
  When an individual Id is selected from the dropdown menu, the Gauge chart displays the weekly washing frequency;s value, and displays the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart
